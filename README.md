# GAP ECS PoC

**Game Agent Protocol (GAP) â€“ ECS Proof-of-Concept**

This repo explores using a small ECS-powered game world to prototype the **GAP protocol**:
- Publish game state via WebSocket at 30 Hz
- Accept simple `intent` messages (`move`, `say`, `use_potion`)
- Run local/AI agents via Python or Rust clients
